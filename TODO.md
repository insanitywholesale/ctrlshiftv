# things to do
- actually implement the call(s) to urlshort
- env var for grpc server URL/port/address

- the above possibly requires a whole lot of rework of the structs
- write tests
- gRPC for codes
- write "frontend"
- implement postgres Find and Store
- implement sqlite Find and Store
- rethinkdb repository option
