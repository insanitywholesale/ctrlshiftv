# things to do
- fix regression in commit 285f038c922c1634684952ef042351d291fdeeaf
- actually implement the call(s) to urlshort
- gRPC for codes
- env var for grpc server URL/port/address
- remove the extras, implement only the interface to send pastes
- the one above possibly requires a whole lot of rework of the structs
- implement sqlite Find and Store
- rethinkdb repository option
- write "frontend"
- write tests
